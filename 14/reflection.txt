Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.


In all the course I saw the power of functions by using them in different scenarios and when I sort a list in my project using a function help me a lot and the final results arenÂ´t complicated.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

As a developer is normal to make mistakes and testing our functions allows us to avoid common mistakes and see if the code is working as expected.
And this saves us a bunch of time and effort in the long term.

3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

Most of the time I use the print to see the values of the variables before and after the statement. 
if things get complicated I use the debugger.

I can improve my process for troubleshooting by splitting the problems before start trying to solve them. Because I realized that sometimes I waste time because I tried to solve everything at once.
